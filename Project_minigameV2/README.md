## An Arduino Project

**this readme is written by Astelor**

## Purpose

This is my first Arduino project coded with vscode, so there might be some bugs lurking somewhere underneath a leaf.
This project is a minigame device, with max7219 7 segment display(8 digits), and a 4x4 Keypad.

## How To Play
### nAnB
1. when in `[======]` menu, press `A` for nAnB
2. you have infinite guesses for the game, type in the answer using the 3x3 numberpad, use `*` as backspace and `#` as submitting the answer
3. if the answer is incorrect, it'll display the number of `A` and `B`. Repeat step 2 unitil you have the correct answer. `A` means you submitted the correct number on the correct digit, `B` means you submitted the correct number, but it's on the wrong digit.
4. if the answer is correct, it'll display `4A0B` for 1 second before returning to the menu

> if you want to know the answer key before solving it yourself, press `A`, the answer key will show up for 1 second before returning to the menu.
