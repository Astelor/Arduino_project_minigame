## How To Play
Since it's a ~~crappy~~ mini game device, a manual of instructions must be provided.
### nAnB

1. When in `[======]` menu, press `A` for nAnB
2. You have infinite guesses for the game, type in the answer using the 3x3 numberpad, use `*` as backspace and `#` as submitting the answer
   > Every number from 0~9 can appear more than once, for example:`9999` and `0909` can be a generated answer key.
4. If the answer is incorrect, it'll display the number of `A` and `B`. Repeat step 2 unitil you have the correct answer. `A` means you submitted the correct number on the correct digit, `B` means you submitted the correct number, but it's on the wrong digit.
3. if the answer is correct, it'll display `4A0B` for 1 second before returning to the menu

> If you want to know the answer key before solving it yourself, press `A`, the answer key will show up for 1 second before returning to the menu.
>
> If you want to play the game again, just press `A` again, it'll generate another answer key and start a new game.
